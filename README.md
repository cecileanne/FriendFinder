# FriendFinder

Homework 13, Due Saturday 10/26/19

## What is FriendFinder?

FriendFinder is an application that allows users to find their perfect match from our pool of users. By filling out our introductory survey, we find the users that most closely matches yours. You may also run the app in your terminal (it works best currently using express as your server until we can get the results to publish cleanly)

## Getting Started

1. NPM dependencies (if copying and/or using your terminal):

- express
- path

After pulling this folder to your computer please make sure to load all of your npm packages as listed above.

## How to use - web browser

1. Simply go to https://enigmatic-taiga-91784.herokuapp.com/ to run our deployed app on heroku.

2. Fill out our survey

3. You will be alerted with which member of our users you most closely match with

## How to use - terminal

1. Navigate to the folder you have pulled and run "node server.js" from your command line.
2. You will receive a notification that the app is listening at a certain port (a 4 digit number)
3. Open a webbrowser and as a url type in "localhost:" followed by the 4-digit port number you got in step 2.
4. Fill out the survey and click the submit button.
5. Return to your terminal -- your results will be console logged there!
